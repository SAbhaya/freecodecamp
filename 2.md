# CSS

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:
```
<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```
Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ;

Style block

```{css}
<style>
</style>
```

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. 
For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

```
<style>
  h2 {color: red;}
</style>
```
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s).
You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags.
Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

```
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the `<style>` tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:
```
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```
Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element.
```
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
```
