# CSS

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ;


Style block

```{css}
<style>
</style>
```

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. 
For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

```
<style>
  h2 {color: red;}
</style>
```
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s).
You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags.
Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.
